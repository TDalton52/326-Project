326 Project

Team Name: Team Hay
Application Name: 5 college scheduler

Team Overview:
Thant Kyaw Hset: (@thantkyaw10)
Tim Dalton: @TDalton52
Chris Overstreet: @C-Overstreet

Innovative Idea:
Our idea was to make a 5 college scheduler that scrapes course data from all 5 colleges in the 5 college area. The user can then search the scraped data to build a schedule out of it. Users can also rate courses and professors from 1-5 stars so that future students can get an idea of what courses and/or professors they should take. In this rating section, users can also leave comments about the courses they've taken. We were thinking something similar to SPIRE, but broad enough to connect all of the colleges and with the rating feature.

Important Components:
The key pieces of this application will be as follows:
1. A scraper to collect course and professor data
2. A search feature to search through the scraped data
3. A star-based rating system for users to leave rating feedback
4. A comment section for users to discuss the classes they've taken and why they liked or didn't like them
